# Colors Generator App

A simple Flutter project that shows the text **"Hello there"** in the center. Tapping anywhere on the screen changes the background to a randomly generated **RGB** color (supports up to **16,777,216** colors).

## Features
- Change the background color randomly with each tap.
- Display the current color in **HEX** (e.g., `#FF5733`) and **RGB** (e.g., `RGB(255, 87, 51)`) formats below the text.
- Copy the current colorâ€™s HEX code to the clipboard with a confirmation snackbar.
- Undo the last color change (disabled if no previous colors exist).
- Smooth color transition animation (0.666 seconds).
- Adaptive text color (white for dark backgrounds, black for light) for readability.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application, demonstrating state management with `setState` and a modular structure suitable for beginners.
